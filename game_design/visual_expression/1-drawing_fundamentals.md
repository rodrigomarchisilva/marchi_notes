## Graphite

- Comes from Greek `graphos` (`to write`).
- Discovered in Cumberland, England, XVI century.
- It was believed that it came from lead.
- Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that it came from carbon, not lead, in XVIII century.
- Around 1800, it started being covered with wood.
- Pencils were yellow to make them easier to notice on the table.
- Carpenters and artists were the main users of graphite pencils.
- When price was raised during Napoleonic wars, it was mixed with clay, in XIX century.
- Nowadays, cedar and pine are used to make graphite pencils.
- It is also used in batteries, blocks, lubricants, etc.

### Grades

- It goes from 9B to 9H.
- **H:** Hard and lighter lines.
- **B:** Soft and darker lines.
- **HB:** Hard and black.
- **F:** Fine and thin lines.

## India Ink

- India ink is a highly pigmented and opaque ink, typically made from carbon black pigment and a binder, such as shellac or acrylic resin.
- It is commonly used for drawing, calligraphy, and illustration, and can be applied with a pen, brush, or other drawing tool.
- India ink is known for its rich, velvety black color, which can create bold and striking contrasts in drawings.
- It is waterproof and lightfast, meaning that it is resistant to fading and can withstand exposure to water or sunlight.
- India ink can be used for a variety of drawing techniques, including cross-hatching, stippling, and washes.
- It dries quickly, which can be an advantage for artists who prefer to work quickly or in multiple layers.
- India ink is often used in combination with other drawing media, such as pencils or pastels, to create a range of visual effects.
- With practice and experimentation, India ink can be a versatile and expressive medium for drawing and illustration.

## Crosshatching

- Cross-hatching is a drawing technique that involves creating a pattern of closely spaced parallel lines, which intersect with another set of lines at a diagonal angle.
- It is commonly used to create shading and texture in drawings, particularly in pen and ink illustrations.
- The density, spacing, and direction of the lines used in cross-hatching can be adjusted to create a wide range of visual effects, from subtle variations in tone to bold and dramatic contrasts.
- Cross-hatching can be used to create a sense of depth, by layering lines of different densities and spacing to suggest the contours and shapes of three-dimensional objects.
- It is a versatile technique that can be used in a variety of styles, from realistic and naturalistic drawings to more stylized and abstract designs.
- Cross-hatching requires a steady hand and a good sense of spatial relationships, as the artist must carefully control the placement and direction of the lines to achieve the desired effect.
- With practice, cross-hatching can become a powerful tool for expressing form, texture, and depth in a wide range of artistic media.

## Watercolor

- Watercolor is a type of paint made from pigment and a binder, typically gum arabic. When mixed with water, the paint becomes transparent, allowing the white of the paper to show through and giving the painting a luminous quality.
- Watercolor is known for its ability to create a wide range of effects, from delicate washes to bold and vibrant colors.
- It is a versatile medium that can be used for a variety of painting techniques, including wet-on-wet, wet-on-dry, and glazing.
- Watercolor dries quickly, making it well-suited for artists who prefer to work quickly or in multiple layers.
- It can be used on a variety of surfaces, including paper, canvas, and other materials.
- Watercolor can be mixed with other water-based media, such as gouache or acrylic, to create unique effects.
- Unlike oil or acrylic paints, watercolor is generally considered to be more difficult to control, requiring a degree of spontaneity and fluidity in the painting process.
- With practice and experimentation, watercolor can be a highly expressive and versatile medium for painting, capable of creating a wide range of visual effects and moods.

## Colored pencils

- Colored pencils are made from a mixture of pigments, binders, and other additives, typically encased in a cylindrical wooden or plastic barrel.
- They come in a wide range of colors, from soft pastels to bright, bold hues.
- Colored pencils are a popular medium for drawing and coloring, particularly for their ability to create fine, detailed lines and a range of textural effects.
- They can be used alone or in combination with other drawing media, such as graphite pencils, to create a range of visual effects.
- Colored pencils are typically used on paper, but can also be used on other surfaces such as canvas, fabric, or wood.
- They can be blended or layered to create a range of tones and shades, allowing for a high degree of control and precision in the drawing process.
- Unlike other drawing media such as ink or watercolor, colored pencils are generally considered to be less messy and easier to control, making them a popular choice for artists of all skill levels.
- With practice and experimentation, colored pencils can be a highly versatile and expressive medium for drawing and coloring, capable of creating a wide range of visual effects and moods.
