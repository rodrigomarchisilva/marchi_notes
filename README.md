## 👋 About

- This is a documentation where I take notes about things I learn.
- I use it as a way to keep track of what I learn and to help me remember things.
- I also use it as a way to help me learn more about things I already know.
- Some things might be in english, some in Brazilian portuguese, and some in both.
- I might also use it to write down some tips and tricks I find useful, that could help others.
- If you want to use it, feel free to do so. If you find any mistakes, or improvements, please let me know.
