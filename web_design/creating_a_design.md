# Creating a design

## Wireframe

- Wireframes is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.
- Purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose.
- Can use on mobile apps like `Concepts` and desktop tools like `Figma`, `Sketch`, `Adobe XD`, etc.
- It also can be done by hand, using just paper and pencil.

## UI Layout

- A way to improve the wireframe, but without adding any colors or images.
- You can also use the same tools as wireframes.

### Using Figma

- Create a new design file.
- Click on `#` and create a new frame.
- Select you frame type, for example `Desktop`, in `Design` tab.
- Change `width` and `height` to **1920 x 3500**, default monitor size.
- Of course, height will vary depending on the content.
- Rename to `Homepage`.
- Create a new frame that will be the grid.
- Resize the `Grid` to **1200 x 3500**.
- Add a new `Layout grid`.
- Change from `Grid` to `Columns`, and set it to `12` to be just like libraries, such as `Bootstrap`.
- You can then drag and drop sketches in svg, or another image format to the side of the frame, to base your design on.
- Now you are ready to work on the design.
